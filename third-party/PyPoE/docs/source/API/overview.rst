The API of PyPoE provides many classes and functions to access the proprietary
file formats in an attempt to recreate and open source a lot of Path of Exile
functionality for generic purpose tool programming.

It is a good idea to take a look at the :ref:`modindex` to get started - the
relevant modules are located under the :mod:`PyPoE.poe` tree.
