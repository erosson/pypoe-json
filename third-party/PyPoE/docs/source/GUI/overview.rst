Overview
==============================================================================

The graphical user interface of PyPoE features various utilities split up into
several applications.

Those applications can be accessed though the launchpad, which can be run
with:

:command:`pypoe_ui`


The individual applications (except the launchpad) can also be directly invoked
through the command line by executing the top-level __init__.py file:

:command:`python <install_path>/PyPoE/ui/<appname>/__init__.py`

So for example:

:command:`python /home/myuser/PyPoE/ui/ggpk_viewer/__init__.py`
