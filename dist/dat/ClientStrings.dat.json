At the top of the Sarn Encampment is an entrance to Sarn Arena, an area for open, unstructured player-slaying.\r\n\r\nWant something more structured? You can duel individual players, or form a team and fight as a group. Path of Exile also supports a Capture the Flag game mode.\r\n\r\nThere are two main PvP brackets -- Open PvP, which has no limits on player level, and Low Level Dueling (LLD) which is limited to players of level 28 or below.\r\n\r\nLeo Redmane in the Sarn Encampment offers daily PvP missions, and rewards active PvPers with Hideout decorations and crafting options, similar to other Forsaken Masters.\r\n\r\nDying in a PvP area on a Hardcore league does not send you to Standard, but if you die to another player outside of a PvP area, such as during the Act 2 Bandit questline, you will be sent to Standard as normal.\r\n\r\nNote that special damage scaling rules are in place for PvP to level the playing field to some degree. Even so, the difference in both player skill and gear can be extreme, so don't become discouraged if you get slaughtered on your first try.",

Instead, it simply consumes a number of flask charges based on the flask you're using, and, once empty, must be refilled before it can be used again. Flasks can come in normal, magic or unique rarity, but not rare. \r\n\r\nUsually, flasks refill as you slay monsters. This means as long as you're successfully engaging in combat, you should always have a flask or two available for use. But if you get into a spot of trouble and empty your flasks, you'll either have to carefully slay enough monsters to refill them or return to Town. \r\n\r\nYour flasks also refill when you return to Town, so jumping into a portal is a valid strategy when you're running low on flask charges. Some flasks, such as those with the 'Surgeon's' prefix, can be refilled based on other conditions.",

If you want to grow The Elder's influence, your best bet may be to target Shaper-influenced areas or areas with no influence at all.\r\n\r\nAs The Elder's influence grows, you may find that several maps become inhabited by The Elder's guardians. Completing these maps involves tough boss encounters, but if you manage to do it, they may lead to The Elder itself.\r\n\r\nMonsters in Shaper- or Elder-influenced maps can drop special versions of items that are also Elder- or Shaper-influenced. These items can roll special (and often very powerful) mods that are not ordinarily available.",

In other words, if you complete a tier 10 map, a new objective may appear on a tier 9, 10 or 11 map. The exceptions are tier 1 maps (which can cause objectives to appear on tiers 1, 2 or 3) and tier 16 maps (which can cause objectives to appear on tiers 14, 15, and 16).
